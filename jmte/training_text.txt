We scored twelve runs in the 4th inning because of some shoddy defense by Marco's team.
This play remains perdurably etched in baseball history as the greatest play at the plate of all time.
There is nothing like being in a train wreck at home plate especially if you hang on to the ball for the out.
I screamed for Billy to throw it and he did.
I jumped in front of home plate and the ball deflected off my glove and Joe just crushed me. He bounced off me and rolled behind home plate.
However, when I went to submit my timetable, I was asked to pay the rest of my tuition.

I am looking to drive more so I can get my G2, I am solid in my belief that I am going to Brantford on the 26th, I am no longer indecisive, I want to get away from the issue between my parents, and I am looking to be very assertive for college.
go to their houses and smash their faces in because they like to aggravate.
etc. or you have the folks trying to tell you that Superman was horrible.
just giggle giggle giggle thats all they do everyday all day and all they need is a boyfriend and someone to laugh with.
Honestly, I think it means that we will be SAFER for the next few months traveling.
we're down to the final weeks of summer people.
I just wanted someone I can confide about the difficulties I faced at work and the void in my life.
I have yet to establish a career for myself.
Yet, I do not know the means to achieve them.
I hate going to the dentist, well hate is a strong word.
My sister will remain in Michigan, so I thought I'd be coming back here occasionally, but she and I have had several vicious, scarring fights this summer.
I've considered not coming home for holidays to see my family because I dislike this town so much.

What if nothing goes as planned and I can't get a job and I'm stuck doing something that I hate.
I had a really nice conversation with Juckett, another amazing one with Phil, and then another one with Solomon.

And Brad couldn't wait to get home.

That last one alone has been responsible for more fear-mongering than the presently seated Bush administration has been able to muster in the past six years, and that's a pretty tall order.
And it makes pretty clear the idea that the continuation of this charade of voting booths and elected officials is never going to turn America around and make it the Utopia that many hope it will become; unless the people get serious about organizing and ceasing this selfish, alienating style of life that we cling to.
