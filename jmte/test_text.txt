After watching the middle-aged geeky character, Seymour Steve Buscemi in Ghost World, I can't but help agreeing with him.
Go ahead, care about the environment, but don't care about demeaning women.
I don't like the movie Top Gun.
So i did, and then the second dog growls at me too, and Im like  Should I run or keep walking.
And then, just the other day, I was driving down 470 on the way to college, listening to 105.5, and a beautiful song came on that I had not heard before.
Naturally, it took a few lines to catch my attention, and I began to pay attention just as those two lines were being sung by Ms. Middler.
I love the two guys who work at that Starbucks - they're awesomely flamboyant and they told me about how Cameron Diaz came in for a latte during their shift last week but without Justin.
I didn't see Will Smith although the French Prince is usually my shit, I think I would have had to punch him on behalf of everyone who's heard Switch, but the girl on the elevator with me said she had just randomly seen Mike Myers.
Then she proceeded to call me Meghan** and went through the required but hilariously inapplicable hazardous chemicals/safety concerns set of questions while the interns around me tried to stifle their laughter.
The next interview is with the general manager of the store, it will likely take place on Saturday.
I said that I want to work in the TV department as I want to learn more about them.
when I got home I was really nervous I hadn't talk to Gareth for 2 days because of college.
:D.
Agreeing.
and disgusting.
and I love them.
And sadly.
Argh.
because I dislike her very much.
Ew.
filling, which sucks.
Frenchie Fucked Off.
fucking A.

Funny photo's came out there.

Hahaha.
happy, laughing out loud wow.
I pride myself on listening to a wide variety of music.
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   why do i hate life?.
i just wanna have fun and be happy and simple like all my friends.
It's like Christmas presents in reverse.
i'm really lucky about that.
Hurt if that person say's yes and down the line you brake up.
I'm sorry someone died, but to mislead me like that is inexcusable.
Which, to be honest, was making Brad slightly nervous.
He called Yohji, missing him, wanting to talk to him.
Goodbyes break my heart and make me choke on my last words.
It's pretty sweet and I feel very blessed that I have it.
I get such a laugh out of that every time.
How do you know that smoke is not from a tire, and the car could be on fire.
And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live.
I felt really awful through out the whole day too.
